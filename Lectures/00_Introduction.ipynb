    "## A brief history of measurement (length)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ancient Egypt, (~3,000 BC) people used a measure called a CUBIT.  This word comes from a Latin word “cubitum” which meant elbow and it was the length of a person’s outstretched forearm -  from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger.  It was based on the Pharaoh’s body: the ROYAL CUBIT.  A stick was marked with this distance and copies were distributed to merchants throughout the land.  When the Pharaoh died, a new Pharaoh took the throne, a new Royal Cubit came into being, and a new stick and it’s copies had to be made and sent across the land.  Plus, there were OTHER problems:  The lengths that people wanted to measure were sometimes shorter or longer than a cubit.  So other lengths like the PALM, DIGIT, and FOOT were used.  7 PALMS was the same as 1 CUBIT.  The ROYAL FOOT was equal to about 18 fingers or ⅔ of a Royal Cubit.\n",

    "<img src=\"img/EgyptCubitStick.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "<img src=\"img/EgyptCubitStick_2.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside the Ancient Egyptians, people throughout the Mediterranean used parts of their bodies to create units of measurement.  Mediterranean sailors used Fathoms to measure depth.  The Hebrew people of long ago used a measurement called a SPAN.  Hand spans are still a unit used to measure horses!  The people of Ancient Greece adapted the Egyptian-Hebrew measurements and added more measurements based upon multiples of fingers.  Ancient Romans created a measurement meant based on the width of the thumb or “uncia” in Latin.  That’s where the word for INCH comes from.  Roman armies measured the distance from one step to another using PACES.  A PACE was equal to 2 Egyptian cubits and is still used to describe speed in foot races.  The word MILE comes from the Latin word “milliare,” a distance of 1,000 paces covered by the Roman army at a forced march.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/BodyLengthUnits.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Roman empire spread, the Roman measuring units became the accepted system of measurement throughout Europe.  A Roman FOOT was equal to 12 UNCIA.  These uncia came to England and over time became INCHES.  Like the Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt, the King of England at the time also wanted to STANDARDIZE (or make the same) the units of measurement across the land based on his own body.  A royal decree went out: a YARD was to be the distance from the nose to the tip of the middle finger of the outstretched arm...or about 3 FEET.  From this time, all units were derived from the King’s foot and yard.  The English Mile was derived from that.  This English or Customary system spread back down through Europe and across the ocean to North America with the English who arrived here.  As trade and communication increased again, once again a more uniform or regulated system was needed.  It took several hundred years for the Customary system to become more and more dependable and standardized.  In 1855, a new distance for a yard was formalized.  This was still about the size of the original Roman yard.  Since then all of the other units of measurement for length have been derived from multiplications and divisions of the Yard.  1 Inch was 1/36 of a yard.  1 Foot was ⅓ yard.  \n",

    "<img src=\"img/EnglishLengthUnits.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "While the English or Customary system came to be widely used in Europe, and is still used here in the United States, today there is another widely used system of measurement that is not based on the measurements of the human body.  It’s beginnings can be found in the 1600s in Europe, when people began to talk about finding better STANDARDS for measurement.  In the 1790s, a group of French scientists decided to create a new standard of measurement that would be unchangeable.  The name for the unit of measure chosen was the METER; it was based upon a measurement of the Earth.  The system they developed is called the METRIC SYSTEM and it is still in use today, throughout France, Europe and almost every nation in the world.  All scientists use the Metric system because it is the most precise.  The length of the meter was taken to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator along a line of longitude near Paris, France.  The word meters comes from the Greek word “metron” which means to measure.  The metric system is based on multiples of 10.\n",

    "\n",
    "from https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kilogram:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"For more than a century, the kilogram (kg) — the fundamental unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) — was defined as exactly equal to the mass of a small polished cylinder, cast in 1879 of platinum and iridium.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Kept in a triple-locked vault on the outskirts of Paris, the platinum-iridium cylinder was officially called the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK). It even had a nickname: Le Grand K (The Big K). The accuracy of every measurement of mass or weight worldwide, whether in pounds and ounces or milligrams and metric tons, depended on how closely the reference masses used in those measurements could be linked to the mass of the IPK.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"That situation has changed radically. In November 2018, the international scientific community voted to redefine the kilogram, freeing it from its embodiment in one golf-ball-sized artifact, and basing it instead on a constant of nature. That transformation was as profound as any in the history of measurement.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/mw_kilogramme.jpg\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\"After 1960, the kilogram was the only SI unit still defined in terms of a single manufactured object. So to ensure the accuracy of mass and weight measurements, all the standard masses used in all the measurements around the globe were, in theory, to be directly compared to the IPK — which was kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Sèvres, France.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In the United States, the dissemination of mass — indeed, of all seven SI base units — is the responsibility of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST houses and maintains what were America's official mass standards until 2019. The K20 mass served as the primary prototype national standard. The other, called K4, served as a “check” standard that monitors the constancy of K20’s mass.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Not surprisingly, making intermittent comparisons among various artifacts was extremely laborious and involved many stages of repeated measurements. More problematic, however, was the fact that the measured mass of each individual standard changed, or \"drifted,\" a bit over time. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Moreover, this mass-comparison system was not easily scalable from large to small. The smaller the scale, the larger the uncertainty in measurement, because a very long sequence of comparisons is necessary to get from a 1 kg standard down to tiny metal mass standards in the mg range, and each comparison introduces an added uncertainty. As a result, although a 1 kg artifact can be measured against a 1 kg standard to an uncertainty of a few parts in a billion, a milligram measured against the same 1 kg has relative uncertainties of a few parts in ten thousand.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"That uncertainty is not satisfactory for the ever-more-demanding needs of modern measurement science, device manufacture, material science, pharmaceutical research and testing, and environmental monitoring, to name only a few. Increasingly, those endeavors require accurate measurements on the order of micrograms (millionths of a gram) and smaller. There was widespread agreement that the world needed a system in which scaling measurements did not mean increasing uncertainty.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The problems with the old system of defining mass were addressed in November 2018 when a group of 60 nations voted to redefine the kilogram in terms of an invariant of nature: the Planck constant. Scientists around the world laid the groundwork for that change for years.\"\n",
