Each strain gage is connected to a separate, but identical, quarter-bridge Wheatstone bridge with $V_s = 6.00$ VDC. Resistor $R_3$ is used as the strain gage in each of the two bridge circuits. The strain gage factor is $S = 2.081$ for both strain gages, and the bridges are balanced when there is no load. \n",
